{Cross-Body Crunch,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,Lie flat on your back and bend your knees about 60 degrees. Keep your feet flat on the floor and place your hands loosely behind your head. This will be your starting position. Now curl up and bring your right elbow and shoulder across your body while bring your left knee in toward your left shoulder at the same time. Reach with your elbow and try to touch your knee. Exhale as you perform this movement. Tip: Try to bring your shoulder up towards your knee rather than just your elbow and remember that the key is to contract the abs as you perform the movement; not just to move the elbow. Now go back down to the starting position as you inhale and repeat with the left elbow and the right knee. Continue alternating in this manner until all prescribed repetitions are done.  Variation: You can also do all of your repetitions for one side and then switch to the other side.}
,{Single-arm high-cable side bend,strength,abdominals,cable,intermediate,Connect a standard handle to a tower. Move cable to highest pulley position. Stand with side to cable. With one hand, reach up and grab handle with underhand grip. Pull down cable until elbow touches your side and the handle is by your shoulder. Position feet hip-width apart. Place free hand on hip to help gauge pivot point. Keep arm in static position. Contract oblique to bring the weight down in a side crunch. Once you reach maximum contraction, slowly release the weight to the starting position. The weight stack should never be unloaded in a resting position. The aim is constant tension during the set. Repeat to failure. Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.  Tip: Keep your arm tucked in tight to your side; donâ€™t move it. This technique will ensure the weight is isolated directly to the obliques and not your biceps or shoulder.}
,{Elbow-to-knee crunch,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,Lie on the floor, crossing your right leg across your bent left knee. Clasp your hands behind your head, beginning with your shoulder blades on the ground. This will be your starting position.

As you do so, flex the spine, bringing your arms back over your head to perform a simultaneous crunch motion. After a brief pause, return to the starting position.}
{Gorilla Chin/Crunch,strength,abdominals,body_only,beginner,Hang from a chin-up bar using an underhand grip (palms facing you) that is slightly wider than shoulder width. Now bend your knees at a 90 degree angle so that the calves are parallel to the floor while the thighs remain perpendicular to it. This will be your starting position. As you exhale, pull yourself up while crunching your knees up at the same time until your knees are at chest level. You will stop going up as soon as your nose is at the same level as the bar. Tip: When you get to this point you should also be finishing the crunch at the same time. Slowly start to inhale as you return to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can also add resistance by holding a dumbbell or medicine ball between your feet but this should only be done by the most advanced athletes. Alternatively, when you are very advanced you can also try the one-arm version where you grasp your wrist with your free hand and you work the obliques more.}

{Smith Machine Reverse Calf Raises,strength,calves,machine,beginner,Adjust the barbell on the smith machine to fit your height and align a raised platform right under the bar. Stand on the platform with the heels of your feet secured on top of it with the balls of your feet extending off it. Position your toes facing forward with a shoulder width stance. Now, place your shoulders under the barbell while maintaining the foot positioning described and push the barbell up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Tip: The barbell on your back is only for balance purposes. Raise the balls of your feet as you breathe out by extending your toes as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position for a second before you start to go back down. Slowly go back down to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering the balls of your feet and toes. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can also have someone place a dumbbell in between your feet for resistance. You can also perform this exercise using a doorstep and you can use the sides of the door frame for balance. If you change the position of the platform by putting it forward or backwards, it will emphasize the higher or lower calf. Similarly, the stance you use can affect where it hits; the closer your feet are, the more the sides will be isolated, whereas the further apart your feet are, the more the front tibialis will be targeted.}
,{Dumbbell Seated One-Leg Calf Raise,strength,calves,dumbbell,beginner,Place a block on the floor about 12 inches from a flat bench. Sit on a flat bench and place a dumbbell on your upper left thigh about 3 inches above your knee. Now place the ball of your left foot on the block. This will be your starting position. Raise your toes up as high as possible as you exhale and you contract your calf muscle. Hold the contraction for a second. Slowly return to the starting position, stretching as far down as possible. Repeat for your prescribed number of repetitions and then repeat with the right leg.  Variations: You can perform this exercise also with both legs at the same time as well as using a seated calf raise machine.}
,{Ankle Circles,stretching,calves,none,beginner,Use a sturdy object like a squat rack to hold yourself. Lift the right leg in the air (just around 2 inches from the floor) and perform a circular motion with the big toe. Pretend that you are drawing a big circle with it.

{Bent Over Two-Dumbbell Row With Palms In,strength,middle_back,dumbbell,beginner,With a dumbbell in each hand (palms facing each other), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The weights should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. While keeping the torso stationary, lift the dumbbells to your side as you breathe out, squeezing your shoulder blades together. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second. Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution:  This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues. Ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a low pulley instead with a V-bar or with a barbell.}
,{Upside-down pull-up,strength,middle_back,other,intermediate,Begin by taking a medium to wide grip on a pull-up apparatus with your palms facing away from you. From a hanging position, tuck your knees to your chest, leaning back and getting your legs over your side of the pull-up apparatus. This will be your starting position. Beginning with your arms straight, flex the elbows and retract the shoulder blades to raise your body up until your legs contact the pull-up apparatus. After a brief pause, return to the starting position.}
,{Bent Over Barbell Row,strength,middle_back,barbell,intermediate,Holding a barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing down), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. Now, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause. Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues. Also, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a supinated (palms facing you) grip.}
,{Single-arm cable seated row,strength,middle_back,cable,intermediate,To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked. Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the single handle attachment with your left arm using a palms-down grip. With your arm extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lat as you hold the bar in front of you. The right arm can be kept by the waist. This is the starting position of the exercise. Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it as you rotate the wrist, so that by the time your hand is by your abdominals it is in a neutral position (palms facing the torso). Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Tip: Remember to rotate the wrist as you go back to the starting position so that the palms are facing down again. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the right hand.  Variations: You can perform this movement with a high pulley as well and standing up. You can also perform it doing a full rotation of the wrist. In other words, at the starting position you will have the palms of the hands facing down and at the end of the movement they will be facing up. Great movement to perform for a variety of purposes.}
,{Kettlebell alternating renegade row,strength,middle_back,kettlebells,intermediate,Place two kettlebells on the floor about shoulder width apart. Position yourself on your toes and your hands as though you were doing a pushup, with the body straight and extended. Use the handles of the kettlebells to support your upper body. You may need to position your feet wide for support.

Lower the dumbbells back to your shoulders, then bend over as you squat down to return the weights back to the floor in front of you. Repeat for reps.}
,{Dumbbell bent-over row,strength,middle_back,dumbbell,intermediate,With a dumbbell in each hand (palms facing your torso), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward by bending at the waist; as you bend make sure to keep your back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The weights should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. While keeping the torso stationary, lift the dumbbells to your side (as you breathe out), keeping the elbows close to the body (do not exert any force with the forearm other than holding the weights). On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second. Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution:  This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues. Ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can promote back injury. Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a low pulley instead with a v-bar or with a barbell. This exercise can also be performed with supinated or neutral grips.}
